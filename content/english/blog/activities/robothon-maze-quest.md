And here our journey comes to a spectacular close as we wrap up Robothon: The Ultimate Maze Quest, one of the most electrifying highlights of Delta 5.0!

From high-speed runs to innovative problem-solving, the event was packed with energy, creativity, and technical brilliance. Participants brought their A-game, showcasing the true spirit of robotics and teamwork.

A massive thank you to Delta 5.0, our incredible Event Coordinator, Event Managers, Mentors, Organizing team, and Volunteers. Your dedication and hard work made this event a remarkable success.

This may be the end of Robothon, but itâ€™s just the beginning of even greater innovations ahead.
