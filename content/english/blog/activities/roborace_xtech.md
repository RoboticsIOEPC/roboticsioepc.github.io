A huge congratulations also goes out to team Optimus for their impressive run as runners-up, team T7 for their award-winning design, and team Robosta for emerging as a top contender. Our sincerest gratitude to X-Tech Studio 3.0, the Robotics Club family, and all of those who contributed to the success of this exhilarating event.
