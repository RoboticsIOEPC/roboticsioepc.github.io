## Why This Matters

Windows 10 support is ending on **October 14th, 2025**.

This change is expected to make **over 250 million computers obsolete**, pushing them toward **landfills as e-waste**—a serious environmental hazard. But your device doesn't need to become part of that problem.

Instead of throwing away a perfectly working computer, you can **breathe new life into it with Linux**—a free, fast, and open-source operating system that respects your freedom and privacy.

> If you are a robotics enthusiast you'll need to use Linux one way or another. Be it while playing with computer vision or dabbling into Robot Operating System or doing any other task. So, why not start early and be comfortable with your future OS.

## What's Happening?

We at the **IOEPC Robotics Club** are hosting a **Linux installation party** where we:

* Help you **install Linux** on your laptop or PC
* Teach you how to **use Linux** (it’s easier than you think!)
* Talk about **Free & Open Source Software (FOSS)** and how it powers tech around the world

This event is part of the global **EndOf10** initiative. Go to [endof10.org](https://endof10.org) for more information.

## Before You Come

Please **backup all your important data** before attending. If you’re not sure how to do it or don’t have the resources, **we can help you back it up but, only if you don't have too many files in your drive**, doing it beforehand **is very much encouraged** and will make things smoother!

  🔄 Note: **Your main disk will be formatted** to it's initial state, so backing up is essential.
