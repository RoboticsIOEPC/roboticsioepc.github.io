The Mini Hardware Hackathon was a follow up event of the 'Basic Robotics and Microcontroller Boot Camp'  organized by EXCESS and the Robotics Club, in association with the Free Student Union(FSU) at IOE Purwanchal Campus. Huge thanks to our incredible mentors, enthusiastic participants, and dedicated organizers. Contragulations to the winners and all the participants on intergrating their skills into innovative and creative projects. Your passion and hard work were truly inspiring.

Thank you all for making this event a success. We look forward to more exciting events in the future!
