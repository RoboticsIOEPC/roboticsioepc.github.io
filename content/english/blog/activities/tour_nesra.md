We just completed an amazing virtual tour of the International Space University, organized by NESRA Nepalese Space Research Association and co-organized by our Robotics Club - Purwanchal Campus. As space enthusiasts, we learned so much about the university and the latest space technology. A huge thank you to the professor of the University, the president of NESRA, the student ambassador, and all of the volunteers from the robotics club for their hard work in conducting this event at the IOE-Purwanchal campus. It was truly an unforgettable experience for all of us, and we are grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow with such dedicated and passionate individuals. Thank you again!
