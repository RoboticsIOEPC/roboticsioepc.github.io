We have come to an end of your two days LaTeX Workshop facilitating 45+ participants. We would like to extend our warmest thankyou to our facilitator Er. Binilraj Adhikari  for his time, guidance and fun filled session. Also we would like thank our collaborative hands ACES - Association of Computer Engineering Students & Electronics And Communication Engineering Student Society, Nepal without whom this workshop wouldn't have been a grand success. And a huge appreciation to all the active participation. 

Together we have unlocked the power of LaTeX, embraced it's beauty and precision in document creation. Here's to new skills and a future filled with beautifully formatted documents!
